All this is is setting up a command prompt window shortcut to automatically
generate a path to the downloaded files, alongside steps on how to compile 
and run for anyone using command prompt.

Instructions assume Windows OS

Setting Things Up

1) Go to Windows search bar at the start menu and search for "command prompt"
2) Click "Open File Location"
3) Right click "Command Prompt" in the opened file explorer window
4) Hover over "Send To" in the generated menu and click 
   "Desktop (create shortcut)"
5) Make sure you have downloaded and unzipped the files from github
6) Find where the files from github are located in file explorer
7) Copy the path to the folder
8) Right click the shortcut icon of command prompt and click "properties"
9) Under the shortcut tab find "Start in:" and paste the path to the files
10) Click apply and close the window

Preparing to Run the Program

1) Open up the command prompt shortcut
2) Type "g++ main.cpp zoomieAlgorithm.cpp -o z.out"
3) Check to see an executable file in the folder containing program files
4) Type "z.out" in the command prompt window to run!

After the Set Up

Do NOT edit the zoomies.csv excel sheet manually. If you do, make sure to
reset using the program functions and everything should be fine. If needed,
a back-up "prezoomies.csv" file will be generated to store information.

That's it! After you finish the preparations, next time you want to run the
program all you have to do is open the command prompt shortcut you set up and
type "z.out" (Assuming that all the files are still in the right folder).
