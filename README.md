# Zoomies

Randomly pairs a list of people together and saves past pairing information.   
Designed with the purpose that each person in a large group is able to have a 1-on-1 conversation with everyone.  
Data stored in a csv file, coded in C++  
  
Currently this program only works for groups who have a set number of people over the course of pairing.   
  
Improvements that might be implemented:  
Accomadating changing lists of people  
Application and GUI development
